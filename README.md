### _**How to Use:**_

To get started, you must configure the program. You can do this by editing the **[config.json](https://github.com/itsrxmmy/tsunami/tree/main/tsunami/config.json)** file. If you do not know how to modify JSON files, it is a good idea to learn before making changes to the file. DO NOT move, rename, or delete the **[tsunami](https://github.com/itsrxmmy/tsunami/tree/main/tsunami)** folder or its **important** contents (see a list of its important contents below) or there may be complications with the software. It's a good idea to delete the previous version(s) of **tsunami** that you already have when downloading a new one to avoid complications.

Once you open **tsunami**, enter the amount of messages you would like to send to your target(s) and let the program do the rest.

**tsunami** is slow as of right now but there will soon be an ASYNCIO update allowing for faster mail flooding.
