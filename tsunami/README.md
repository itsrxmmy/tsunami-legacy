_**How to Use:**_

To get started, you must configure the program. You can do this by editing the **[nami.json](https://github.com/itsrxmmy/tsunami/tree/main/tsunami/nami.json)** file. If you do not know how to use json files, it is a good idea to learn before making changes to the file. DO NOT move the **[tsunami.exe](https://github.com/itsrxmmy/tsunami/tree/main/tsunami/tsunami.exe)** file or the **[nami.json](https://github.com/itsrxmmy/tsunami/tree/main/tsunami/nami.json)** file out of the **[tsunami](https://github.com/itsrxmmy/tsunami/tree/main/tsunami)** folder, DO NOT rename the files OR the folder, and DO NOT delete the files OR the folder. It's a good idea to delete the previous version(s) of Tsunami when downloading a new one to avoid complications.

Once you open Tsunami, enter the amount of messages you would like to send to your target(s) and let the program do the rest.

Tsunami is slow as of right now but there will soon be an ASYNCIO update allowing for faster mail flooding.
